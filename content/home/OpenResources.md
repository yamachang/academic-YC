### **Data Science in  R**
**UPMC Western Psychiatric Hospital | Fall 2021**

I organized and developed a R workshop with four sessions including introduction to R, data wrangling, data visualization, and data analysis. Each session includes a 10-minute presentation to cover the learning goal and concept of each topic, following by a learning-by-doing module. This workshop aimed to guide everyone with no prior experience in R to feel comfortable with coding and eventually apply R coding skills in research projects. Please find the materials including slides and R scripts on my [GitHub](https://github.com/yamachang/R_workshop_2021fall). Please feel free to reach out for recordings.
