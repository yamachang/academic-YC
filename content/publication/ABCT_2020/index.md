abstract: Gender-questioning refers to an individual feeling uncertain about their gender identity. While minority stress and mental health outcomes among sexual and gender minority individuals (SGM) are gradually being studied, few research studies have focused on gender questioning youth. It is highly possible that adolescents who are struggling with their gender identity also suffer from minority stress such as stigma and internalized homophobia, which are significantly associated with suicide risk. The present study examines whether gender questioning youth have a higher risk of attempting suicide than heterosexual counterparts. Furthermore, we investigate several minority stress-related factors to identify the intervention targets in school settings. This study conducted a second-data analysis using national sample data from the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (N= 10,264). The outcome variables and predictors in the study are attempted suicide, minority stress, hopelessness while controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender questioning youth had higher odds of suicide attempts than heterosexual youth ([AOR] = 3.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.34â€“4.09). Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that feeling threatened at school, electronic bullying, sadness or hopelessness were predictors of suicide attempts among gender questioning youth. Our findings have important clinical implications for suicide intervention in SGM youth, specifically for gender questioning individuals. School-based clinicians should consider the context of peer victimization, the minority stress framework, resilience, and identity development in order to develop a more effective treatment strategy. Interventions such as enhancing social support, teaching skills in conflict resolution, and improved problem-solving skills would ameliorate burden from experiencing electronic bullying and threats at school. In addition, identifying events that trigger feelings of sadness or hopelessness would further decrease risk of suicide attempts among gender-questioning youth.
