<p>In young and middle-aged adults, suicidal ideation is an important predictor of prospective suicide attempts, but its predictive power in late life remains unclear. In this study, we used <strong>Latent Profile Analysis (LPA)</strong> in a cohort of depressed older adults to identify distinct ideation profiles and their clinical correlates and test their association with risk of suicidal behavior longitudinally.</p>
                    <p>This peer-reviewed article has been published on <a href="https://www-psychiatrist-com.proxy.library.stonybrook.edu/jcp/depression/long-term-suicidal-ideation-profiles-late-life-depression-association-suicide-attempt-death/">The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry</a>.</p>
                    <p>As the lead data analyst and the third author of this project, I performed Latent Profile Analysis, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and χ2 tests using R. To provide a more comprehensive view of our results, I depicted the clinical characteristics using radar plots and represented long-term changes in suicidal ideation with time-series data spanning 2500 days.</p>
