<p>This study applied a data-driven method to identify suicidal subtypes by conducting a latent profile analysis to examine suicidal ideation trajectories in a longitudinal sample.</p>
<p>In this study, I was responsible for applying analytic models and visualized data using radar plots and line plots.</p>
<p>We are currently finalizing the manuscript.</p>
