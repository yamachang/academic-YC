<p><strong>Objectives</strong><br>
To examine the relationship between childhood traumatic experiences and early and late-onset suicidal behavior among depressed older adults.</p>

<p><strong>Methods</strong><br>
Our sample included 224 adults aged 50+ (M ± SD = 62.5 ± 7.4) recruited into three depressed groups: (1) 84 suicide attempters, (2) 44 suicide ideators, and (3) 58 non-suicidal comparisons, and a non-psychiatric healthy comparison group (N = 38). The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire measured experiences of childhood trauma such as emotional abuse, physical abuse, emotional neglect, physical neglect, and sexual abuse.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong><br>
Attempters were separated into early- and late-onset based on age of first attempt using a <strong>Gaussian mixture model (GMM)</strong> that identified a cutoff age of 30 years old.<br>

Overall, we found group differences in emotional and physical abuse and neglect in both genders and sexual abuse in females, but not in males. Early-onset attempters experienced more childhood emotional abuse and neglect than late-onset attempters and were more likely to have experienced multiple forms of abuse. They also experienced more emotional abuse and neglect than all comparison groups. Consistently, early-onset attempters more often met criteria for current or lifetime PTSD relative to late-onset attempters and most comparison groups. Late-onset attempters had similar levels of childhood trauma as other depressed groups.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong><br>
Our study reaffirms that there are distinct pathways to suicidal behavior in older adults based on their age of first suicide attempt and that trauma experienced in childhood has long-lasting emotional and behavioral consequences, even into late life.</p>
