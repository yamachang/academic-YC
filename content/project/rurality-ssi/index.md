<p><strong>Objective</strong><br>
Rural teens are less likely to access care for depression than urban teens. Evidence-based digital single-session interventions (SSIs), offered via social media advertisements, may be well-suited to narrowing this gap in treatment access and increasing rural adolescents’ access to support. We evaluated the viability of using social media-based advertisements to equitably recruit rural adolescents with elevated depression symptoms online SSIs; we sought to characterize and assess whether SSI completion rates and acceptability differed for rural versus more urban adolescents, across three intervention conditions (two active, evidence-based SSIs; one placebo control); and we tested whether digital SSIs differentially reduced depressive symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Method</strong><br>
We used pre-intervention and three-month follow up data from 13- to 16-year-old adolescents (N = 2,322; 88% female; 55% non-Hispanic White) within a web-based randomized control trial of three free, online SSIs (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: blinded for review) collected eight months into the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong><br>
Digital SSIs reached rural and urban adolescents at population-congruent rates; however, social media ads resulted in relative underrepresentation of rural youths who holding minoritized racial/ethnic identities. Rural adolescents also completed digital SSIs at similar rates to their urban peers, found SSIs equivalently as acceptable, and reported comparable depression symptom reductions as urban youth.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
Digital SSIs and their dissemination through social media may offer a promising means of narrowing the gap between rural and urban adolescents’ access to evidence-based mental health support; however, targeted efforts are warranted to reach racially minoritized youths in rural U.S. counties.</p>
