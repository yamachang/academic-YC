<p>In this project, I embarked on the challenge of quantifying discrimination using real-world data. Structural stigma, which encompasses discrimination embedded in societal-level conditions, cultural norms, and institutional policies, has a significant impact on LGBTQ+ individuals in the U.S. While established methods exist to measure individual and interpersonal stigma, quantifying structural stigma poses a unique challenge due to its complex macro-social nature.

To address this, I designed an approach using Confirmatory Factor Analysis, utilizing a variety of variables that represented both explicit and implicit attitudes specific to LGBTQ+ individuals from an open data set, Project Implicit. This allowed us to create an index of county-level structural stigma. The resulting factor, when visualized on a U.S. map, provides an illuminating representation of the structural stigma landscape across the country. It helps us better understand the macro-social context and pervasive challenges that LGBTQ+ populations in the U.S. encounter in their day-to-day lives.</p>
                    <p>Data for this project was sourced from the open-access repository of <a href="https://osf.io/y9hiq/">Project Implicit</a>. We specifically utilized the most recent data, spanning from January to December 2022, with the aim of capturing current societal attitudes towards LGBTQ+. This was achieved by aggregating responses from two separate data sets — Sexuality IAT and Transgender IAT — where participants expressed their implicit and explicit attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community. Importantly, the data included <code>zip codes</code> provided by the participants, enabling us to link the model-generated factor scores to the corresponding county-level structural stigma.</p>
