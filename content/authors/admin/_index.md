I am a Senior Research/Data Analyst at the Lab for Scalable Mental Health at the Department of Psychology at Stony Brook University. Overall, I am fascinated with everything data related. I am interested in applying data-driven approaches to (1) study the mechanisms underlying structural stigma and adverse mental health outcomes; (2) improve upon existing methodologies and assessments to detect quantifiable signals surrounding stigma; and (3) examine modifiable risk factors to develop accessible, scalable intervention targets, with the ultimate goal to reduce health disparities in stigmatized populations, particularly in sexual and gender minorities.
