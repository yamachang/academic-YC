I am a Data Scientist at the [Lab for Scalable Mental Health](https://www.schleiderlab.org/), working closely with [Jessica Schleider, PhD](https://www.schleiderlab.org/labdirector.html), and my amazing colleagues at [Northwestern University](https://cbits.northwestern.edu/). I have honed my expertise at the intersection of data science and digital mental health. Harnessing computational techniques, I aim to leverage large-scale behavioral and language data to extract actionable insights to improve mental health. My goal is to develop accessible, scalable, evidence-based interventions to ameliorate disparities in mental health care. I am also interested in exploring the potential of large language models and artificial intelligence in delivering timely and personalized mental health tools to individuals in need.
