I am a Data Scientist at the [Lab for Scalable Mental Health](https://www.schleiderlab.org/), working closely with [Jessica Schleider, PhD](https://www.schleiderlab.org/labdirector.html). I have honed my expertise at the intersection of data science and digital mental health. My contributions focus on predicting how effective these tools can be in alleviating mental health symptoms â€” a field that deeply resonates with my interests and passions. Leveraging my background in clinical psychology, I am employing data science to: (1) explore the underlying mechanisms that link structural stigma to adverse mental health outcomes; (2) enhance existing methodologies and assessments for detecting quantifiable indicators of stigma; and (3) investigate adjustable risk factors to create accessible, scalable interventions. The ultimate goal of my work is to diminish mental health disparities in stigmatized communities, with an emphasis on LGBTQ+ individuals.
