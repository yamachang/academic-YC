As the data manager for Dr. Katalin Szanto’s Late Life Suicide program at the UPMC Western Psychiatric Hospital, I manage our longitudinal study’s database, conduct quantitative modeling and analysis for independent and collaborative research projects, and oversee the data team. I am interested in applying data-driven approaches to (1) study the mechanisms underlying multilevel stigma and adverse mental health outcomes; (2) improve upon existing methodologies and assessments to detect quantifiable signals surrounding stigma and suicide risk; (3) better predict the onset of suicidal ideation and prevent the transition to suicidal behaviors; and (4) examine modifiable risk factors to identify scalable intervention targets, with the ultimate goal to reduce health disparities in stigmatized populations, particularly in sexual and gender minorities.
