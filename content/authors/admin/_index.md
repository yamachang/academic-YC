I’m a first-year PhD student in [Quantitative Biomedical Sciences (QBS) at Dartmouth College](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/qbs/), mentored by [Dr. Nicholas Jacobson](https://www.nicholasjacobson.com/) in the [Artificial Intelligence and Mental Health: Innovation in Technology Guided Healthcare (AIM HIGH) Lab](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/jacobsonlab/) at the [Center for Technology and Behavioral Health](https://www.c4tbh.org/).

My research focuses on leveraging **passive sensing**, **wearable devices**, **large language models (LLMs)**, and **just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI)** to deliver personalized support when it’s most needed. I’m particularly interested in integrating multimodal behavioral data with LLMs, optimizing the timing of interventions, and ensuring clinical safety in AI-driven systems. I’m also deeply interested in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics for mental illness and how to support sustainable well-being after treatment.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a master’s in clinical psychology from Columbia University and worked as a data scientist at the [Lab for Scalable Mental Health](https://www.schleiderlab.org/). My work focused on using digital, single-session interventions to expand access to care for marginalized populations, including LGBTQ+ and BIPOC individuals.
